If you want to use Jonathan Shewchuk's Triangle as an alternative
isotropic 2D mesh generator in Gmsh, please download Triangle from the
author's web site at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html,
unpack the archive and copy the two files triangle.c and triangle.h in
this directory. Then run configure and rebuild Gmsh.

Note that by doing so, you agree to Triangle's licencing requirements
stated below. (Most notably, you can only redistribute the software if
no compensation is received.)

Triangle generates exact Delaunay triangulations, exact constrained
Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, and quality conforming Delaunay
triangulations.  The latter can be generated with no small angles or large,
and are thus suitable for finite element analysis.  Show Me graphically
displays the contents of the geometric files used by Triangle.  Show Me can
also write images in PostScript form.

Information on the algorithms used by Triangle, including complete
references, can be found in the comments at the beginning of the triangle.c
source file.  Another listing of these references, with PostScript copies
of some of the papers, is available from the Web page
