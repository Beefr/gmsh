/*
add new optional field in .msh file to store

- node or element post-pro data
- one field per-time step, per view

$Data
name precision-single-double step time-value
type node-or-ele-id num-comp val (num-comp times)
type node-or-ele-id num-comp val (num-comp times)
...
$EndData

Then?

1) in MVertex and MElement, add

std::vector<std::vector<double> > _scalar, _vector, _tensor;

and access using e.g. _scalar[viewIndex][comp & time step]. In GModel
we would store a map with the correspondance between the index and the
unique view id created in PView().

2) Or, we store directly a map indexed with the unique view id

1) and 2) are pretty expensive, due to the overhead and the "micro"
allocations (in each element/node)

3) It might be better to store the data *per entity*?

4) Or just store the big vectors in the GModel?

My preference at the moment is to store per entity (i.e., (3)): not
too much overhead; can do local indexing and checks with
nodes/elements--which are stored per entity too; avoids storing entity
ptr in each value (I think we should have that info in the post-pro:
it's one of the annoying shortcomings of the old format)

f we choose 3, unfortunately, we need to keep track of some local
indices to access the data with a single, continuous index. This is
exactly the same problem as with PViewDataList. Maybe it's worth it?
