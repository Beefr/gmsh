1) About opengl32.dll and glu32.dll:

If your system complains about missing opengl32.dll or glu32.dll
libraries, then OpenGL is not properly installed... Go download OpenGL
on Microsoft's web site or on http://www.opengl.org.

2) About cygwin1.dll:

If you plan to use other programs than Gmsh that depend on the
cygwin1.dll library, you should keep only one version of this library
on your system (i.e., move cygwin1.dll to the Windows system
directory--usually C:\Windows\System\--and suppress all other versions
of cygwin1.dll). Failing to do so may result in an incorrect behavior
of applications sharing the library and running simultaneously.

3) About configuration files:

Gmsh saves session information and default options in the $GMSH_HOME
directory, or in the $HOME, $TMP or $TEMP directories if $GMSH_HOME is
not defined. If none of these variables are defined, Gmsh will
save/load its configuration files from the current working directory.

4) Adjusting the Cygwin memory limit:

From the <cygwin at cygwin.com> mailing list archive (Charles Werner
<cw at gamma-rs dot ch>, Tue 04 Feb 2003 10:31:03 +0100):

Cygwin comes with a maximum program size (program+data) of 384
MB. This means that by default no program can allocate more than
this. To run using more real or virtual memory in your machine you
must add a entry in the Cygwin HKEY_CURRENT_USER section of the
registry. Add the DWORD value heap_chunk_in_mb and set it to desired
memory limit in decimal MB using the regtool program included in the
Cygwin cygutils package. In this example the limit is set to 1024 MB:

regtool -i set /HKCU/Software/Cygnus\ Solutions/Cygwin/heap_chunk_in_mb 1024
regtool -v list /HKCU/Software/Cygnus\ Solutions/Cygwin

Exit all running Cygwin processes and restart them. Memory can be
allocated up to the size of the system swap space minus any the size
of any running processes. The system swap should be at least as large
as the physically installed RAM and can be modified under the System
category in the Control Panel accessible through the Settings tag of
the Win32 Start menu.
