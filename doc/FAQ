GMSH FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

($Id: FAQ,v 1.3 2001-09-05 12:22:38 geuzaine Exp $)


1. GENERAL
==========

1.1) What is Gmsh?

Gmsh is an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh generator,
primarily Delaunay, with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities. Its
primal goal is to provide a simple meshing tool for academic test cases with
parametric input and up to date visualization capabilities.  One of the
strengths of Gmsh is its ability to respect a characteristic length field
for the generation of adapted meshes on lines, surfaces and volumes.

1.2) What does 'Gmsh' mean?

Nothing ;-)

1.3) Where can I find more information?

<http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/> is the primary site to obtain information about
Gmsh. You will e.g. find a searchable archive of the Gmsh mailing list.
Please: Before posting to the list, read this FAQ and the available
documentation. This way you help people focus on topics that have not yet
been resolved.


2. INSTALLATION
===============

2.1) Which OSes does Gmsh run on?

Windows 95/98/NT/2000, Linux (with glibc > 2.1), Compaq Tru 64 Unix,
Sun OS, IBM AIX, SGI IRIX, HP-UX.

2.2) Are there additional requirements to run Gmsh?

You must have OpenGL (or Mesa) libraries installed on your system.


3. GENERAL PROBLEMS
===================

3.1) Gmsh complains about missing libraries.

Try 'ldd gmsh' to check if all required shared libraries are installed on
your system. If not, install them.

3.2) Gmsh does not work under HP-UX.

The HP version is reported not to work with native OpenGL. You should
install Mesa instead.

3.3) Gmsh keeps re-displaying its graphics when other windows partially hide
the graphical window.

Disable opaque move in your window manager.


4. GEOMETRY PROBLEMS
====================

4.1) Does Gmsh support NURBS curves/surfaces?

Not yet.


5. MESH PROBLEMS
================

5.1) What should I do when the 2D unstructured algorithm fails?

Try the new algorithm:
- on the command line: gmsh -algo tri
- in the interface: Options->Mesh->Algorithm->Isotropic (Triangle)
- in input files: Mesh.Algorithm = 3
The old 2D algorithm will disappear once all the features of the old one are
integrated, so please don't send bug reports for the old algorithm anymore.

5.2) What should I do when the 3D unstructured algorithm fails?

The 3D algorithm is still very experimental. Try to change some
characteristic lengths in your input file to generate meshes that suit the
geometrical details better.

5.3) I changed the characteristic lenghts, but the 3D algorithm still does
not work. What should I do?

Buy a professional mesh generator ;-)

5.4) The quality of the elements generated by the 3D algorithm is very bad.

Yes, this is normal. At the time of this writing, we do not post-process the
delaunay mesh, so that some badly shaped tetrahedra will likely subsist in
any unstructured 3D mesh. This will be fixed in the future.

5.5) Non-recombined 3D extruded meshes sometimes fail.

The swapping algorithm is not very clever at the moment. Try to change the
surface mesh a bit.


6. SOLVER PROBLEMS
==================


7. POST-PROCESSING PROBLEMS
===========================

7.1) The graphics display very slowly.

Are you are executing Gmsh from a remote host (via the network) without GLX?
You should turn double buffering off (with the -nodb command line option).

7.2) Big post-processing scenes are slow to display.

Try display lists (-dl command line option).
