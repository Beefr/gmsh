* All surface meshes are made in a mean plane. If your surface cannot
be projected into a plane with a 1-to-1 correspondance between the
nodes, then gmsh will fail. We should mesh in the parametric space in
these cases.

* Improve Triangle integration: bgmesh on file, 2nd intermediate
mesh?, etc.

* purify, purify... The old 2D algorithm (mainly mesh_domain()) is
full of large memory leaks.
