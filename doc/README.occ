How to build OpenCascade 6.3 (OCC) for Gmsh:

- Get the source distribution of OCC and unpack it (you only need the
  "ros" subdirectory). In the following <OpenCascade dir> refers to
  the directory where OCC is installed (e.g ~/OpenCASCADE6.3.0)

- OS/compiler specific stuff:

   * On Windows, use Visual C++ to compile the libraries, or use the
     precompiled DLLs directly. (The MinGW compiler used to work with
     OCC 6.2 but do not anymore with 6.3.)  See README.msvc for
     instructions on how to compile Gmsh with Visual C++.

   * on Mac OS X unfortunately you cannot build universal libs simply
     by using "-arch i386 -arch ppc" (the code depends on
     configure-time endinanness checks). So, first configure and build
     with

     export CFLAGS="-arch i386"
     export CXXFLAGS="-arch i386" 

     and then do "make distclean" and configure and build again
     with 
     
     export CFLAGS="-arch ppc"
     export CXXFLAGS="-arch ppc"

     after the install step, use "lipo" to merge both archs, e.g.

     lipo -create libi386.a libppc.a -output libuniversal.a

- Go to the <OpenCascade dir>/ros directory and type

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/opencascade --enable-debug=no 
    --enable-production=yes --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no
    --disable-dependency-tracking

- Then go to the <OpenCascade dir>/ros/adm/make/ directory and
  run "make" in the following subdirectories, e.g. by running the
  following bash script:

    #!/bin/bash
    for lib in TKernel TKMath TKAdvTools TKG2d TKG3d TKGeomBase TKBRep 
      TKGeomAlgo TKTopAlgo TKPrim TKBO TKHLR TKMesh TKShHealing TKBool 
      TKFillet TKFeat TKOffset TKXSBase TKIGES TKSTEPBase TKSTEPAttr 
      TKSTEP209 TKSTEP; do
        cd $lib && make; cd ..;
    done

   Note that this is the same as doing "make FoundationClasses", "make
   ModelingData", "make ModelingAlgorithms" and part of "make
   DataExchange"

- Finally, run this other bash script in the same directory (to install
  the libraries)

    #!/bin/bash
    for lib in TKernel TKMath TKAdvTools TKG2d TKG3d TKGeomBase TKBRep 
      TKGeomAlgo TKTopAlgo TKPrim TKBO TKHLR TKMesh TKShHealing TKBool 
      TKFillet TKFeat TKOffset TKXSBase TKIGES TKSTEPBase TKSTEPAttr 
      TKSTEP209 TKSTEP; do
        cd $lib && make install; cd ..;
    done

  and copy config.h and the <OpenCascade dir>/ros/inc/ subdirectory
  to /usr/local/opencascade (This is the same as a doing a partial 
  'make install')

OpenCascade is now installed and ready to be used by Gmsh. To compile
Gmsh with OpenCascade support:

- Go to the gmsh source directory

- Run "./configure --enable-occ --with-occ-prefix=/usr/local/opencascade" and
  then "make"

- If you get errors like

    undefined reference to `pthread_create'
    undefined reference to `pthread_detach'
    ...

  edit the "variables" file and add "-pthread" to the OPTIM variable, e.g.:

    OPTIM="-g -O2 -pthread"
   
  and run make again

- If compiling is successful then you are done and you can enjoy
  importing IGES/STEP/BREP files into Gmsh!
