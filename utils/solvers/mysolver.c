/* This file contains a dummy client solver for Gmsh. It does not
   solve anything, but shows how to program your own solver to interact
   with the Gmsh solver module.
   
   To compile this solver, type something like:

   gcc -o mysolver.exe mysolver.c GmshClient.c
   
   To test this solver, copy the mysolver.opt file into your default
   Gmsh option file, or lauch Gmsh with the command:
   
   gmsh -option mysolver.opt */

/* We start by including some standard headers. Under Windows, you
   will need to install the cygwin tools (http://www.cygwin.com) to
   compile this example (as well as your own solver), since the Gmsh
   solver interface uses Unix sockets. */

   of this writing, the client interface contains only three

   simple interactions between a solver and Gmsh. */
