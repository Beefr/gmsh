This is Gmsh, an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh
generator, primarily Delaunay, with built-in pre- and post-processing
facilities.

To install Gmsh, type

./configure
make
make install

This requires the GSL (version 1.2 or higher; freely available from
http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/) and FLTK (version 1.1.x, configured
with OpenGL support; freely avialable form see http://www.fltk.org),
to be installed on your system. If not in default locations, you can
either use the --with-fltk-prefix and --with-gsl-prefix configure
options, or you can set the environment variables FLTK_DIR and
GSL_DIR.

To install a non-graphical version of Gmsh (that does not require
FLTK nor OpenGL), type

./configure --disable-gui
make
make install
