This is Gmsh, an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh
generator with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities.

To install Gmsh, type

./configure
make
make install

This requires FLTK 1.1.7 or above, configured with OpenGL support.
FLTK is freely available from http://www.fltk.org. To install a
non-graphical version of Gmsh (that does not require FLTK), type

./configure --disable-gui
make
make install

For a description of all other configuration options, type

./configure --help

To build Gmsh with Microsoft Visual C++, follow the intructions in
doc/README.msvc.
