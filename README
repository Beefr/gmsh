This is Gmsh, an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh
generator, primarily Delaunay, with built-in pre- and post-processing
facilities.

To install Gmsh, type

./configure --with-fltk-prefix=/path/to/fltk-1.1.x
make
make install

This requires the Fast Light Tool Kit (FLTK, http://www.fltk.org)
version 1.1 or above, the GNU Scientific Library (GSL,
http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/) and OpenGL (for a free implementation,
see http://www.mesa3d.org) to be installed on your system. If not in
default locations, you can either use the --with-fltk-prefix,
--with-gsl-prefix and --with-gl-prefix configure options, or you can
set the environment variables FLTK_DIR, GSL_DIR and GL_DIR.

To install a non-graphical version of Gmsh (that does not require
FLTK nor OpenGL), type

./configure --disable-gui
make
make install
