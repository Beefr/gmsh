This is Gmsh, an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh
generator, primarily Delaunay, with built-in pre- and post-processing
facilities.

To install Gmsh, type

./configure
make
make install

This requires GSL 1.2 or higher (freely available from
http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/) and FLTK 1.1.x (configured with OpenGL
support; freely available from http://www.fltk.org). You can use the
--with-fltk-prefix and --with-gsl-prefix configure options (or define
the FLTK_PREFIX and GSL_PREFIX environment variables) if the libraries
are not installed in their default locations.

[ WARNING: Do not use FLTK 1.1.7. FLTK 1.1.7 has a few serious bugs
that can lead to seemingly random crashes in Gmsh. FLTK 1.1.6 is OK,
as are most SVN revisions anterior to {"2005-10-10"}. Unfortunately,
both 1.1.6 and all these versions come with a buggy JPEG header: if
you enable the local JPEG library when you configure FLTK, you will
have to remove the "#include <config.h>" line in the file
"jconfig.h". ]

To install a non-graphical version of Gmsh (that does not require FLTK
nor OpenGL), type

./configure --disable-gui
make
make install

For a description of all other configuration options, type

./configure --help
