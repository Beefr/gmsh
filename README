This is Gmsh, an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh
generator, primarily Delaunay, with built-in pre- and post-processing
facilities.

Gmsh is free software. See the file doc/COPYING for copying
permission. Parts of Gmsh are distributed with additional license
requirements. Check individual files for more information. Most
notably, if you incorporate the Triangle/ library, Gmsh can only be
redistributed if no compensation is received.

Type 'make' to build Gmsh. This requires FLTK version 1.1.x to be
installed in $(HOME)/SOURCES/fltk-1.1

See the doc/ and tutorial/ directories for documentation.

See the demos/ directory for additional examples.
