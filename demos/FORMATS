Gmsh Mesh File Format
=====================

   The 'msh' file format is the native output file format for
   Gmsh. The file is divided in two sections (enclosed in $KEY and
   $ENDKEY pairs): $NOD/$ENDNOD defines the nodes and $ELM/$ENDELM
   defines the elements.

   $NOD
   number-of-nodes
   node-number x-coord y-coord z-coord 
   ...
   $ENDNOD
   $ELM
   number-of-elements
   elm-number elm-type elm-region unused number-of-nodes node-numbers
   ...
   $ENDELM

   All the syntactic variables stand for integers except x-coord,
   y-coord and z-coord which stand for floating point values.  The
   elm-type value defines the geometrical type for the element:
   
   1  Line (2 nodes, 1 edge). 
   2  Triangle (3 nodes, 3 edges). 
   3  Quadrangle (4 nodes, 4 edges). 
   4  Tetrahedron (4 nodes, 6 edges, 4 facets). 
   5  Hexahedron (8 nodes, 12 edges, 6 facets). 
   6  Prism (6 nodes, 9 edges, 5 facets). 
   7  Pyramid (5 nodes, 8 edges, 5 facets). 
   15 Point (1 node). 

   The elm-region value is the number of the physical entity to which
   the element belongs. 


Gmsh Ascii Post-Processing File Format
======================================
   
    A post-processing file is divided in several sections: one
    format section (enclosed between $PostFormat/$EndPostFormat) and
    (possibly multiple) post-processing views (enclosed between
    $View/$EndView pairs). 

    $PostFormat
    version-number 0
    $EndPostFormat
    $View
    name nb-time-steps
    nb-SP nb-VP nb-TP
    nb-SL nb-VL nb-TL
    nb-ST nb-VT nb-TT
    nb-SS nb-VS nb-TS
    time-step-values
    SP-values
    VP-values
    TP-values
    SL-values
    VL-values
    TL-values
    ST-values
    VT-values
    TT-values
    SS-values
    VS-values
    TS-values
    $endView
    $View
    ...
    $EndView
    $View
    ...
    $EndView

    where
    - 'version-number' is a double precision number giving the version
      of Gmsh to which the file is destined (e.g. 0.995)
    - 'name' is the name of the view
    - 'nb-time-step' is an integer giving the number of time steps in the view
    - 'nb-SP', 'nb-VP', 'nb-TP', 'nb-SL', 'nb-VL', 'nb-TL', 'nb-ST', 'nb-VT',
      'nb-TT', 'nb-SS', 'nb-VS' and 'nb-TS' are integers giving the number of
      scalar points, vector points, tensor points, scalar lines, vector lines,
      tensor lines, scalar triangles, vector triangles, tensor triangles,
      scalar tetrahedra, vector tetrahedra and tensor tetrahedra.
    - 'SP-values' is a list of double precision numbers:
      the three first represent the corrdinates of the point
      the 'nb-time-step' following

Gmsh Binary Post-Processing File Format
=======================================

    The binary post-processing file format is the same as the ascii file format,
    except that:
    - the format field is the following
      $PostFormat
      version-number 1
      $EndPostFormat
    - all double precision vectors ('time-step-values', 'SP-values', 'VP-values', etc.)
      are written in binary format
    - AND there is an additional integer written before the 'time-step-values', and
      which contains the value '1'. This integer serves as a test for little/big endian
      detection.

    Here is an example, of C code to write the binary format:

    int one=1;

    fprintf(file, "$View /* %s */\n", name);
    fprintf(file, "%s %g\n", name, version);
    fprintf(file, "$EndView\n");
    
    fwrite(&One, sizeof(int), 1, PostStream);



Gmsh Parsed Post-Processing Format
==================================

   For testing purposes (or with very small data sets), there is an additional,
   post-processing format which is parsed by the same grammar analyser as the
   geometry. You can thus for example embed small post-processing views into your
   geometrical descriptions.

   View "name" {
     type_of_element (list_of_coordinates) {list_of_values} ;
     ...
   }	

   12 base objects can be displayed:

                       type_of_element   list_of_coordinates    list_of_values
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   scalar point        SP                3                      1  * nb time steps
   vector point        VP                3                      3  * nb time steps
   tensor point        TP                3                      9  * nb time steps
   scalar line         SL                6                      2  * nb time steps
   vector line         VL                6                      6  * nb time steps
   tensor line         TL                6                      18 * nb time steps
   scalar triangle     ST                9                      3  * nb time steps
   vector triangle     VT                9                      9  * nb time steps
   tensor triangle     TT                9                      27 * nb time steps
   scalar tetrahedron  SS                12                     4  * nb time steps
   vector tetrahedron  VS                12                     12 * nb time steps
   tensor tetrahedron  TS                12                     36 * nb time steps


   The coordinates are given "by node", that is (x,y,z) for a point, (x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2)
   for a line, (x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2,x3,y3,z3) for a triangle, ...
 
   The values are given by timestep, by node and by component. That is, for a vector line,
   {valxnode1time1,valynode1time1,valznode1time1, valxnode2time1,valynode2time1,valznode2time1,
    valxnode1time2,valynode1time2,valznode1time2, valxnode2time2,valynode2time2,valznode2time2, ...}
