// This defines some characteristic lengths:

lcar1 = .1;
lcar2 = .0005;
lcar3 = .075;

// In order to change these lengths globally (without changing the
// file), a global scaling factor for all characteristic lengths can
// be specified on the command line with the option '-clscale'. For
// example, with:
//
// > gmsh t5 -clscale 1
//
// this example produces a mesh of approximately 2000 nodes and
// 10,000 tetrahedra (in 3 seconds on an alpha workstation running at
// 666MHz). With 
//
// > gmsh t5 -clscale 0.2
//
// (i.e. with all characteristic lengths divided by 5), the mesh
// counts approximately 170,000 nodes and one million tetrahedra
// (and the computation takes 16 minutes on the same machine :-( So
// there is still a lot of work to do to achieve decent performance
// with Gmsh...)

// Instead of using included files, one can also define functions. In

// the highest current point number, plus one. Analogously to 'newp',
// there exists a variable 'newreg' which selects the highest number
// of all entities other than points, plus one.

// Note: there are no local variables. This will be changed in a
// future version of Gmsh.
