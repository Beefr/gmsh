Gmsh is an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh generator,
primarily Delaunay, with built-in pre- and post-processing
facilities. Its primal goal is to provide a simple meshing tool for
academic test cases with parametric input and up to date visualization
capabilities. One of the strengths of Gmsh is its ability to respect a
characteristic length field for the generation of adapted meshes on
lines, surfaces and volumes. These adapted meshes can be mixed with
simple structured (transfinite, elliptic, etc.)  meshes in order to
augment the flexibility.

Parameterized geometries are created by successively defining points,
oriented curves (segments, circles, ellipsis, splines, etc.), oriented
surfaces (plane surfaces, ruled surfaces, etc.)  and volumes. Compound
groups of geometrical entities can be defined, based on these
elementary parameterized geometric entities. Data can be defined
either interactively thanks to the menu system, or directly in the ASCII 
input files.

A finite element mesh is a tessellation of a given subset of R^3 by
elementary geometrical elements of various shapes (in this case lines,
triangles, quadrangles, tetrahedra, prisms and hexahedra), arranged in
such a way that two of them intersect, if they do, along a common
face, edge or node, and never otherwise. All the finite element meshes
produced by Gmsh as unstructured, even if they were generated in
a structured way. This implies that the elementary geometrical
elements are defined only by an ordered list of their vertices (which
allows the orientation of all their lower order geometrical entities)
but no predefined relation is assumed between any two elementary
elements.
<p>
The procedure follows the same order as for the geometry creation:
curves are discretized first; the mesh of the curves is then used to
mesh the surfaces; then the mesh of the surfaces is used to mesh the
volumes. This automatically assures the continuity of the mesh when,
for example, two surfaces share a common curve. Every meshing step is
constrained by the characteristic length field, which can be uniform,
specified by characteristic length associated to elementary
geometrical entities, or associated to another mesh (the background
mesh).
<p>
For each meshing step (i.e. the discretization of lines, surfaces and
volumes), all structured mesh directives are executed first, and serve
as additional constraints for the unstructured parts. The implemented
Delaunay algorithm is subdivided in the following five steps for
surface/volume discretization:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
trivial meshing of a box including the convex polygon/polyhedron
defined by the boundary nodes resulting from the discretization of the
curves/surfaces; 
<li>
creation of the initial mesh by insertion of all the nodes on the
curves/surfaces thanks to the Bowyer algorithm; 
<li>
boundary restoration to force all the edges/faces of the
curves/surfaces to be present in the initial mesh;
<li>
suppression of all the unwanted triangles/tetrahedra (in
particular those containing the nodes of the initial box); 
<li>
insertion of new nodes by the Bowyer algorithm until the
characteristic size of each simplex is lower or equal to the
characteristic length field evaluated at the center of its
circumscribed circle/sphere.
</ol>

Multiple post-processing scalar or vector maps can be loaded and
manipulated (globally or individually) along with the geometry and the
mesh. Scalar fields are represented by iso-value curves or color maps
and vector fields by three-dimensional arrows or displacement
maps. Post-processor functions include offsets, elevation, interactive
color map modification, range clamping, interactive and scriptable
animation, vector postscript output, etc. All post-processing options
can be accessed either interactively or through the the input ascii
files.
